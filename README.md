This repository contains a collection of jsonnet libraries that are automatically generated using [`k8s-gen`](https://github.com/jsonnet-libs/k8s). The libraries are not being published to the [jsonnet-libs](https://github.com/jsonnet-libs/k8s-libsonnet) repository because they do not match the same use case as the libraries there.
The libraries published here are not necessarily Kubernetes related. They are just libraries that are generated using the same tooling.

You can find the documentation for the libraries by following [this link](https://EmbarkStudios.github.io/jsonnet-libs).
